# ai-camera-sensor
camera sensor with ai object and depth perception

## Goals
- implement open source ais that can take a webcam feed, identify objects, and give distance and location estimates of object
- test the model in a virtual environment like unity
- design compact sensor design with a basic camera and microcontroller 

## Scope
- input: rgb camera video feed
- output: live video output with object labels, bounding boxes, distance, confidence of estimate
